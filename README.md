# Introduction 
The project involved developing an application that could generate and track service requests allocated to different employees or departments, including everything from furniture to flowers, food to translators. The application also needed to be able to read maps in the hospital and interpret that information quickly to new visitors. Features like displaying convenient simple signs to more advanced pathfinding were implemented to promote visitors making informed decisions while navigating the sprawling hospital complex. We divided the project into several stages, with each stage building on the previous one, and we used agile methodology to guide our development process.
